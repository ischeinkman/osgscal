# Description

The glideTester is a testing framework aimed at testing
network facing services by using Grid resources.
The aim is to perform the same test at different concurrency
levels in a deterministic way. To fully automate the process,
glideTester heavily leverages the glideinWMS system for this purpose.

The Condor daemons and the glideinWMS glidein
factory daemon are used unmodified, and configured and
operated as suggested by the glideinWMS manuals. All the
Condor monitoring and debugging features are thus
available.

The tester daemon instead replaces the VO frontend.
The reason for reimplementing the frontend is simple;
the frontend provided with the glideinWMS is designed to be reactive;
its modus operandi is to monitor a Condor scheduler for
waiting jobs and to request glideins if there are any.
What we need instead is to first create the needed glidein
pool and then submit the test jobs.

Our system does not assume anything about the test
jobs; it only submits them and saves the output. In order to
prevent data loss, a separate subdirectory is created for each
instance of the test jobs. Moreover, to keep bookkeeping
manageable, the job directories are grouped by the
concurrency level.

Analysis of the output of the tests is beyond the current
scope of the framework, although may be implemented in
the future. However, the tester daemon does provide the exit
status of the test jobs for each completed concurrency level.

# Installation and Setup

## Pre-Installation

Before installing GlideinWMS, the host must be able to accept incoming HTTP requests on port `80`, and must be able to redirect URL paths to a folder location writeable by the user that GlideTester will run as. In addition, the `glideinwms` library should be installed somewhere reachable via the default Python `import`. For example by install the glideinwms libraries RPM

```console
yum install glideinwms-libs
```

In addition, the factory must be configured to be able to accept glidein requests from
the frontend's name and identity. Currently, GlideTester uses a hard-coded security class of 0. For example, for a username of `t001` on a factory called `glidein-1.t2.ucsd.edu`, the config entry might be:

```xml
<frontend name="t001" identity="t001@glidein-1.t2.ucsd.edu">
    <security_classes>
        <security_class name="0" username="t001"/>
    </security_classes>
</frontend>
```

## Frontend Setup

Before running GlideTester the user must create both a Frontend Configuration folder and Frontend WebStruct folder. This is done by running the following command:

```
[PATH_TO_INSTALLATION]/bin/createTesterWebStruct.py
```

In greater detail, the webstruct creation script creates a standard Frontend `workDir` and `webStageDir` and the specified paths to be used by both the `glideinwms` library and the factory. After the `webStageDir` is created, the user must add a URL redirect so that the configured `webURL` resolves to the `webStageDir`.

For example, if the glidetester host is running `httpd` with a hostname of `glidetester.example.org` the `glidetester.cfg` file contains the lines

```
webstruct.webStageDir = /etc/glidetester/webStageDir
webstruct.webURL = http://glidetester.example.org/weburl
```

Create a config file named `glidetester.conf` and place in `/etc/httpd/conf.d`:

```xml
Alias /weburl /etc/glidetester/webStageDir
<Directory /etc/glidetester/webStageDir>
        # Apache 2.2
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>
```

This will correctly redirect `GET` calls to the appropriate files. Note that GlideTester
does **not** require the directory index feature of many http serves to be enabled; the
webstruct creator automatically generates an empty `index.html` file at the root of the `webStageDir`.

# Running

To start a new run with the default configuration and executable, call the following from the terminal:

```
[PATH_TO_INSTALLATION]/bin/glideTester.py
```

This will start start a new test job, grabbing configuration and job execution details as described by the next section.

# Configuration

The GlideTester program is configured via one or more configuration files. These files are a series of key-value pairs, one pair per line, of the format `KEY=VALUE`. An example is included in the `etc` folder.

## File Locations and Priorities

The GlideTester program allows for configuration to be split between multiple specific locations. These locations are checked in a set priority, with options in lower priority files only being check if they do not exist in higher priority locations.

The priority list, from highest priority to lowest priority, is as follows:

1. The path specified via the `-cfg` or `--config` path, if it exists.

2. `~/.config/glideTester/glideTester.cfg`, if it exists.

3. `/etc/glideTester/glideTester.cfg`.

4. `os.path.join(sys.path[0], '../etc')` **NOTE: For development purposes only. Normal installs should instead rely on the default configuration at `/etc/glideTester/glideTester.cfg`.**

# Running

Like the general configuration, a GlideTester "job" is represented and passed as a `parameters.cfg` file containing `KEY=VALUE` pair lines. The file follows the exact same priority list as the main `glidetester.cfg` file; note that therefore if a key is missing from a passed `parameters.cfg` file, **GlideTester will first look for corresponding keys in lower priority `parameters.cfg` files before loading the stated defaults!** For this reason the included example `parameters.cfg` file will have all options commented out.

The options are:

| Key | Description | Example | Optional? | Default Value |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `executable` | The path to the executable to run file to run in each of the glideins' shells. |`/home/ilan/osgscal/glideTester/bin/timed_loop.sh` | No | None |
| `concurrency` | A space-separated list of parallel "concurrency levels" to run the executable at, IE the number of Glideins to collect before running the executable on them. Note that glideins will be re-used between concurrency levels. |`5 10 100 1000` | No | None |
| `runs` | The number of times to run each concurrency level. |`1` | No | None |
| `arguments` | The command-line arguments to pass ot the executable. |`--flag flagval  --cluster $(Cluster) arg2` | Yes | None |
| `gfactoryAdditionalConstraint` | Additional constraints on the factory to add to the ClassAd. | `FactoryName=?='TestName'` | Yes | None |
| `initialDirFormat` | The GlideTester Format String (see below) specifying where each job's `InitialDir` will be set to; this directory will include the job's standard out, error, and all other output files. | `{wd}/concurrency_{c}{'_run_' + str(r) if r != '0' else ''}/job{'%03d'%(int(j))}` | Yes | `{wd}/concurrency_{c}_run_{r}/job{j}`
| `prescript` | The GlideTester Format String specifying a script to call before any other GlideTester action, including attempting to build concurrency. | `echo "NOW RUNNING AT {ts}` | Yes | None |
| `postscript` | The GlideTester Format String specifying a script to call after all other activities have ran, including post-final-run Glidin shutoff. Note that this script will *not* be called if GlideTester was interupted, only if it terminated normally. | `echo "NOW FINISHED AT {ts}` | Yes | None |

In addition, the following `condor_submit` parameters are supported and will be added unaltered to generated condor jobs:

* `should_transfer_files`
* `transfer_input_files`
* `transfer_output_files`
* `environment`
* `getenv`
* `x509userproxy`

## GlideTester Format String

Some options, such as `initialDirFormat` in the `parameters.cfg` file, accept a GlideTester Format String.
These format strings are composed of a combination of raw test and valid Python expressions placed
within brackets (`{}`). These expressions are evaluated via `eval`, converted to a string using `str()`, and then
subsituted back into the original string. Different variables can be passed to the `eval` calls depending
on the exact option being used; however, all variables passed in to the format will be of type `str`.

The variables for each GlideTester Format String are as follows:

### `inidialDirFormat`

| Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `c` | The concurrency level that the job is a part of. | `100` |
| `j` | The index of this job within the current concurrency level. Can range from `0` to `int(c) - 1`, inclusive. | `84` |
| `r` | The current repetition number for this concurrency level. Can range from `0` to the value passed to `runs` in `parameters.cfg` - 1, inclusive. | `0` |
| `sd` | The path to the directory that GlideTester was called from. | `/home/testuser/` |
| `ts` | The date and time that this GlideTester command was started, in format `%Y%m%d_%H%M%S` | `20190701_153029` |
| `wd` | The "working directory" of the current GlideTester execution, where all of the GlideTester logs and extra metadata get written to. Currently this should always be equal to `{sd}/run_{ts}`. | `/home/testuser/run_20190701_153029` |

### `prescript`

| Name | Description | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
